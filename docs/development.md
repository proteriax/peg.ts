## Contribute

You are welcome to contribute code using [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/pulls). Unless your contribution is really trivial you should get in touch with me first (preferably by creating a new issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/issues)) - this can prevent wasted effort on both sides.

> Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you've checked out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

_Ensure you have Node.js 8.6+ and Yarn installed._

1. Create a fork of [https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs)
2. Clone your fork, and optionally create a new branch
3. Run the command `yarn install` from the root of your clone
4. Add and commit your changes
5. Validate your changes:
   - Lint the JavaScript changes (command line only, run `yarn lint`)
   - Run tests to ensure nothing's broken: `yarn test` from the root of the repository
   - Run benchmarks to check performance: `yarn benchmark`
   - Check the impact of your commits: [see separate documentation](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/blob/master/tools/impact/README.md)
6. If validation fails: reverse your commit, fix the problem and then add/commit again
7. Push the commits from your clone to the fork
8. From your fork, start a new pull request

It's also a good idea to check out the [package.json](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/blob/master/package.json) that defines various scripts.
